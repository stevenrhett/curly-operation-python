1. **Pathfinding Algorithm** :
   Write a Python program to implement a pathfinding algorithm to find the
   shortest path between two points in a 2D grid. You can use the A* algorithm
   or any other pathfinding algorithm of your choice. The program should take
   as input the start and end points, as well as the obstacles in the grid.

2. **Image Processing** :
   Write a Python program to process an image and extract certain features
   from it. For example, you could write a program
   to detect edges in an image, or to identify objects in an image using
   machine learning techniques.

3. **Web Scraping** : Write a Python program to scrape data from a website
   and save it to a CSV file. You can use a library like Beautiful Soup
   or Scrapy to extract the data. The program should be able to handle
   multiple pages of data and should be robust enough to handle errors
   and exceptions that may arise during the scraping process.
