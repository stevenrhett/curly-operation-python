## How this repo is set up

The problems are listed in the `problems.md` file. Any source data to be used to answer the problems is found in `/data`. The solution files are listed in the `/solutions` and can be ran by TODO

## Steps to breaking down a problem

1. Break down the prompt into key parts.
2. Decide the order that you're going to focus on each part.
3. For each part, think about the key details of that part. Then think through the logic of how you're going to implement that part.
4. Check to make sure that your thinking handles all the parts of the prompt.
